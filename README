#A Lua tool for minifying and reverse engineering minified Lua code

Usage:

    lua minify.lua minify INPUTFILE > OUTPUTFILE 

    lua minify.lua unminify INPUTFILE > OUTPUTFILE

The purpose of the unminifier is to reverse engineer minified code. It both beautifies the code and renames the variables to descriptive names like "L_42_arg2" which can be easily find-replaced while trying to reverse engineer minified code.
