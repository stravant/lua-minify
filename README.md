# Lua Minify

A tool for beautifying and minifying Lua source code. The purpose of the unminifier is to reverse engineer minified code. It both beautifies the code and renames the variables to descriptive names like "L_42_arg2" which can be easily find-replaced while trying to reverse engineer minified code.

For usage info, run `lua main.lua --help`
